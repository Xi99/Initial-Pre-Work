// You can setup your For loop to count backwards if you wanted by making the setup value higher and the while portion to be as long as it is greater than 0. You can then decrease from the initail i value.
// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
for (var i = 9; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
