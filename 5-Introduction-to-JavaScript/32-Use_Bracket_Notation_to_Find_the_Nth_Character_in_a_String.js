// Computers start counting at 0 so in order to get a letter in a string at the index of 3, it would be [2]
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
