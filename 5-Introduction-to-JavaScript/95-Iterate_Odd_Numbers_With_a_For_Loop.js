// You can iterate odd numbers with a for loop by starting the setup to 1 and then having it incriment by 2 from there. You can do a similar setup for even numbers.
// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
for (var i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
